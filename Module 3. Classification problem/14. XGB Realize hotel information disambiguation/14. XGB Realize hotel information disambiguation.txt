The data attributes are different (such as Chinese and English names; whether there is an email address, etc.)
Data forms are different
The amount of data is large and it is unrealistic to compare all of them ()
Risks arising from disambiguation errors (such as the mistake of booking two hotels as the same hotel)

Provide an algorithm service to calculate whether two pieces of data belong to the same hotel
The goal is set to improve operational efficiency and achieve business goals through the combination of algorithms and operational personnel.
It is planned to process the Chinese language first

So it is a classification task.
数据属性不同（如中英文名称；有无邮箱， 等）
数据形态不同
数据量大，全部对比不现实（）
消岐错误带来的风险（比如将两家酒店定成同一家的错误）

提供一个算法服务以计算两条数据是否为同一家酒店
目标设定为提升运营效率，通过算法与运营人员的结合实现业务目标
计划先对中文语言进行处理

所以是一个分类任务。
