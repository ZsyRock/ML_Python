Principle: Find the K samples that are closest to the new data, and select the category with the most samples as the category of the new data.
For example, if a family moves into a wealthy area, they think they are rich.

advantage:
01. Simple and easy to implement: Just organize the data and you’re done.
02. Better effect on data with irregular boundaries

shortcoming:
1 is only suitable for small data sets (because all data are needed to generate the model)
2 Data imbalance is not effective
3 Data must be standardized (the dimensions need to be unified, such as converting to 0-1)
4. Not suitable for data with too many feature dimensions (because there is too little data, the distribution divided into each dimension is even less)

The smaller K is, the easier it is to overfit (strongly related to the results), and the larger K is, the easier it is to be judged as underfitting.

The difficulty lies in the value of K.
原理：找到K个与新数据最近的样本，去样本中最多的一个类别作为新数据的类别
如富人区搬来一户人家，认为他是有钱人。

优点：
01. 简单容易实现：只要把数据整理好，就完成了。
02. 对边界不规则数据的效果较好

缺点：
1 只适合小数据集（因为要所有数据生成模型）
2 数据不平衡效果不好
3 必须做数据标准化（需要统一量纲，如转换到0-1）
4. 不适合特征维度太多的数据（因为数据太少，所以分到每一个维度的分布就更少）

K越小越容易过拟合overfitting（与结果强相关）， K越大越容易被判定为欠拟合。

难点为K值的取值。
