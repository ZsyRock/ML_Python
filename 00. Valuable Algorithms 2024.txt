Focus on 1. Tree model; 2. Neural network
Then I started looking for classic projects on kaggle and saved about 10 projects.
Combine it with graphs and time series, and spend some time focusing on it.

Tree Model: Emphasis
Bayesian: Not used at the moment
Linear Regression/Logistic Regression: Single Layer Neural Network
Markov: There is a high probability that it will not be used
Inheritance Algorithm: Ideas are very important and must be mastered

着重1、树模型；2、神经网络
然后开始在kaggle找经典项目，攒10来个项目
结合图、时间序列，花点时间当作重点。

树模型：着重
贝叶斯：暂时不用
线性回归/逻辑回归：单层神经网络
马尔可夫：大概率用不上
继承算法：思想很重要，必须掌握
