# ML_Python

Welcome to my [Learning Notes of ML](https://github.com/ZsyRock/My_ML_Python/tree/main).

First three models are my review notes and code implementation for data mining and machine learning flowing the [Bilibili site](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1JM4y1k7ie/?p=10&spm_id_from=pageDriver&vd_source=f160d57e4bb83c348ab70a6d94d2f079):

By constantly updating my technical notes, hope I can become a more professional data analyst through this process. 

Starting from the fourth module, I will update some machine learning projects here, including data mining basics, time series analysis, disease prediction and other models.

As an old Chinese saying goes: 

### Review the past and learn the new;


There is an old saying: 

### A good memory is worse than a bad writing.
