# ML_Python

Welcome to my [Learning Notes of ML](https://github.com/ZsyRock/My_ML_Python/tree/main).

The first three modules are the basic part, they are my review notes and code implementation for data mining and machine learning flowing the [Bilibili site](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1JM4y1k7ie/?p=10&spm_id_from=pageDriver&vd_source=f160d57e4bb83c348ab70a6d94d2f079), including:

[Modele 1](https://github.com/ZsyRock/My_ML_Python/tree/main/Module%201.%20Data%20mining%20basics) includes problems that data mining can solve, as well as the basic syntax of python.

[Module 2](https://github.com/ZsyRock/My_ML_Python/tree/main/Module%202.%20Data%20mining%20workflow) includes the data mining workflow in practical applications and how to choose a model.

[Module 3](https://github.com/ZsyRock/My_ML_Python/tree/main/Module%203.%20Classification%20problem) is a summary of common machine learning algorithms and specific principles and application demonstrations.

[Module 4](https://github.com/ZsyRock/My_ML_Python/tree/main/Module%204.%20Summary%20of%20projects) is a summary of practical problems I solved by applying various machine learning algorithms. including data mining basics, time series analysis, disease prediction and other models.

To be specific:

[KNN in ML-sklearn](https://github.com/ZsyRock/ML-for-Diabetes-Prediction/tree/main/KNN%20in%20ML-sklearn)

By constantly updating my technical notes, hope I can become a more professional data analyst through this process.
